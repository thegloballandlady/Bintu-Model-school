In this project, I designed a comprehensive visual dashboard to analyze and interpret key metrics for Bintu Model School. The dashboard provides actionable insights to enhance educational outcomes and improve decision-making processes.

## Key Highlights:

* Student Performance Metrics: Visualized failure rates to identify trends and areas for intervention.
* Demographic Data: Analyzed average student age and its correlation with study habits.
* Time Management Insights: Examined students' average free time and study time, highlighting opportunities for better academic scheduling.
* Impact of Internet Usage: Assessed how internet use affects students‚Äô ability to engage in various activities.
* Guardian Classification: Compiled guardian data and segmented it by classes (G1, G2, G3) for targeted strategies.


## Tools and Technologies Used:
---
Data Cleaning and Transformation: Excel
Data Visualization: Power BI
Analysis Techniques: Statistical methods, trend analysis, and correlation studies.
